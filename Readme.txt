Airline Flights C++ Console Application
-Brandon Knapp

This relatively simple C++ console application is an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. 
Two text files are used to populate a map for city numbering and an adjacency matrix for all paths. 
Data Structures used are a two-dimensional dynamically-declared array, binary heap, and a couple of vectors.
